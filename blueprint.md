# Application Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a static website designed to run on GitHub Pages. It uses modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap 5 for styling and components.

## Project Structure & Design

### Initial Setup
*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the application.
*   **`style.css`**: Contains custom styles for the application.
*   **`main.js`**: For custom JavaScript functionality.
*   **Bootstrap 5**: The Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS (with Popper.js) libraries are included via CDN with SRI hashes for security.

## Current Plan

*   Configure the application to use Bootstrap 5 for styling.
*   Update `index.html` to include the Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS from the official CDN.
*   Ensure Popper.js is included as it is bundled with `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`.
*   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all CDN links to enhance security.
